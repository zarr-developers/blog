Hi everyone! üëã

I hope all of you are doing great and have started using Zarr-Python 3! If not,
install it using `pip install -U zarr` and let us know your thoughts.

I have some news to share with the Zarr community‚Äîafter three wonderful years
of managing the Zarr project and its community, I‚Äôm officially stepping down as
the community manager. My position was funded through the CZI EOSS grant, which
finished towards the end of 2024!

It‚Äôs been quite a journey and an excellent opportunity to learn, grow and
connect with like-minded people in the scientific ecosystem. I‚Äôm fortunate that
I was able to use my skills to contribute to the project. I‚Äôd like to specially
thank my mentor and PI, Josh Moore. Josh has been very kind and understanding
and has always been just, responsible and careful towards me. I couldn‚Äôt be
more lucky to have him on my side.

## Brief summary of my journey

The ‚ÄòCommunity Manager‚Äô role in technical projects involves wearing multiple
hats while fostering and growing the community. It was a great opportunity
which helped me learn a lot of new stuff. I want to highlight some of the
essential things I‚Äôve done in my role over the past few years.


- ZEP‚ÄîZarr is an amazing project with lovely contributors from diverse domains
across the globe. It‚Äôs great to see people contributing to a project and
bringing fresh perspectives. But sometimes, this also poses a challenge. When I
joined, discussions on the Zarr V3 specification were ongoing. There was a lot
of good feedback on the design and what V3 specification should be, but it was
scattered all around GitHub issues and pull requests in multiple repositories.
We knew what we wanted to do, but there was a serious lack of a process that
would help us get from start to finish. So, I started working on a community
feedback process, later known as the Zarr Enhancement Proposal. If you‚Äôd like
to read more, I wrote a [blog post](https://zarr.dev/blog/zep-inception/) back
in 2022. The ZEP process worked great and helped us in finalising the V3
specification (ZEP1) and Sharding specification (ZEP2).

- Maintaining projects under Zarr‚ÄîLooking after the community also
serendipitously led me to take care of several repositories under the Zarr
banner. At first, I launched the Zarr blog using Jekyll and GitHub page and
started writing about releases, contributor guides, roadmaps, etc. Then, I
revamped the Zarr website to add more content and launched another website to
maintain a record of Zarr community meeting notes and community calendar at
(<https://zarr.dev/community-calls/>). Over time, I also launched the ZEP
website, at (<https://zarr.dev/zeps/>). While I was solidifying the Zarr online
presence, I was also fixing bugs, assisting in releases, and sending minor
patches to the Zarr-Python repository. I also ensured that all project licenses
and the Code of Conduct were current and compliant, reinforcing our commitment
to community standards and values.

- Running meetings‚ÄîOne of the important duties of a community manager is to run
community meetings and ensure that all the attendees feel welcome. We host
bi-weekly meetings for the community. We also used to run ZEP meetings
bi-weekly (which we recently stopped) to discuss ZEP proposals. Apart from both
these meetings, I also run office hours, which I started back in early 2023.
Office hours have been a great time for interaction with the community, where
new/experienced users join in, and I help them with their questions. I‚Äôve had
some great conversations over the years with the participants ‚Äî some even led
to open-source contributions to libraries like Xarray
(<https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/9014>).

- Public speaking‚ÄîI started speaking on Zarr a couple of months after joining.  I
remember my first presentation was with Ryan Abernathy at a [Cloud Native
Geospatial event](https://x.com/zarr_dev/status/1516722004858384386). I spoke
about Zarr specifications and their implementations in multiple languages.
Since then, I‚Äôve spoken at various conferences and meet-ups. Please see my
webpage <https://sanketverma.com/talks/> for the full list.

- Representing project interests‚ÄîOver the years, I have been engaged with
multiple steering committees to represent Zarr and its community. See the
complete list at <https://sanketverma.com/about/#open-source-engagement>. These
steering committees drive interesting projects in the open-source ecosystem.
For example, the Scientific Python ecosystem is a federation of
community-developed and community-owned Python projects widely used in
scientific research. I serve on the SPEC steering committee to represent the
interests of Zarr.

- Mentor newcomers‚ÄîOnboarding newcomers to the project was yet another important
duty of mine. Aside from mentoring users regularly, Zarr inaugurated their
participation in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy in 2022. Both these
programs are structured to provide a platform for motivated individuals to
contribute to open source. Josh and I mentored a couple of interns in both
programs.

I also wanted to showcase other things on the list, but I should move on to the
next section for now. ;)

## What's changed?

Since my time as the community manager has come to an end, I think it‚Äôs one of
my responsibilities to start delegating the stuff I was responsible for to
ensure a smooth transition. We have combined the Zarr community and the ZEP
meetings‚Äîas I was running these meetings, we needed to make sure that meetings
would continue to take place with minimal disruption.

We‚Äôll be reducing the frequency of Zarr office hours‚Äîcurrently, we hold them
every 2 weeks, and now we plan to have them once a month. Yes, you guessed it
right, I‚Äôll continue to interact and assist the community during office hours.

The other meetings remain unaffected on our community calendar. Our community
calendar (<https://zarr.dev/community-calls/>) lists all the meetings and is
open to join for everyone. Also, our ZulipChat (<https://ossci.zulipchat.com/>)
continues flourishing and hosting great conversations; please drop by and say
‚ÄòHi‚Äô to the community.

## What's next?

I love the project and the wonderful humans who contribute and use it. Over the
last few years, I‚Äôve become quite familiar with Zarr‚Äôs inner workings, both
technical and non-technical. I‚Äôve also acquired a lot of invaluable
institutional knowledge of the project. I plan to continue contributing to the
project and will participate in the meetings listed on the community calendar,
primarily in a reduced capacity for some time. I‚Äôve taken some time for myself
and have been learning new stuff. Keep an eye out for my
[blog](https://sanketverma.com/blog/). ;)

I think the CZI EOSS grant was the most direct way to work and contribute to
the project, and I‚Äôd like to wholeheartedly thank the CZI for funding us. I
also want to thank the Zarr steering council and the open-source community for
their collective support, feedback and encouragement throughout the years!

As of today, I‚Äôm actively searching for new positions to leverage my technical
and community leadership experience. Please ping me if you think I‚Äôm a good fit
for your team or if you just want to have a nice chat. I‚Äôd be happy to discuss
my experience or help you. You can find my info
[here](https://sanketverma.com/).

See you around in the meetings or probably a conference near you! ;)

Peace! ‚úåüèª
