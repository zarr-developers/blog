# Steering council membership update (November 2024)

From the [Governance documentation](https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council):

> The Zarr Steering Council (ZSC) members are core developers who have
> additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth running of the project. ZSC
> members are expected to participate in strategic planning, approve changes to
> the governance model, and make decisions about funding granted to the project
> itself... The purpose of the ZSC is to ensure smooth progress from the
> big-picture perspective. Changes that impact the full project require
> analysis informed by long experience with both the project and the larger
> ecosystem. When the core developer community (including the ZSC members)
> fails to reach such a consensus in a reasonable timeframe, the ZSC is the
> entity that resolves the issue.

On October 14th, Ryan Williams, a founding member of the ZSC, stepped back. In
the name of the community, the other members would like to thank Ryan for his
support and leadership over the past four years and wish him the best in his
new pursuits!

In his place, [Norman Rzepka](https://github.com/normanrz) will join the
council. Norman has been a key driver of the Zarr v3 specification, the zarrita
prototype, a zarr-java implementation, and more recently the rewrite of
zarr-python for v3.

Please join us in welcoming him! 👏🏽
